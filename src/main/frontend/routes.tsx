/******************************************************************************
 * This file is auto-generated by Vaadin.
 * It configures React Router automatically by looking for React views files,
 * located in `src/main/frontend/views/` directory.
 * A manual configuration can be done as well, you have to:
 * - copy this file or create your own `routes.tsx` in your frontend directory,
 *   then modify this copied/created file. By default, the `routes.tsx` file
 *   should be in `src/main/frontend/` folder;
 * - use `RouterBuilder` API to configure routes for the application;
 * - restart the application, so that the imports get re-generated.
 *
 * `RouterBuilder` combines a File System-based route configuration or your
 * explicit routes configuration with the server-side routes.
 *
 * It has the following methods:
 * - `withFileRoutes` enables the File System-based routes autoconfiguration;
 * - `withReactRoutes` adds manual explicit route hierarchy. Allows also to add
 * an individual route, which then merged into File System-based routes,
 * e.g. Log In view;
 * - `withServerRoutes` adds server-side routes automatically to either
 * autoconfigured routes, or manually configured routes;
 * - `protect` adds an authentication later to the routes.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * - You need to restart the dev-server after adding the new `routes.tsx` file.
 * After that, all modifications to `routes.tsx` are recompiled automatically.
 * - You may need to change a routes import in `index.tsx`, if `index.tsx`
 * exists in the frontend folder (not in generated folder) and you copied the file,
 * as the import isn't updated automatically by Vaadin in this case.
